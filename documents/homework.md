# [Web Application Development](https://gitlab.msu.edu/cse477-fall-2023/course-materials/): Homework Assignments



## Assignments

In the table below, we provide an overview of the 5 assignments due in this course. The assignments are due approximately once a month. Each assignment's requirements (except the Course Exam) builds on the prior assignment, so it's very important that you complete each assignment correctly, and on-time. You should be able to complete each assignment with relative ease if you **start early**, and  watch the lectures.  Solutions to the assignments will not be provided at any point during the course.

<u>NOTE:</u> All due dates are at 11:59PM EST on the due date shown in the above table.



#### Submission Requirements:

Assignments are deemed submitted if, and only if:

1. Relevant code for the assignment is committed to the course Gitlab repository before the deadline.
2. Relevant homework form has been submitted before the deadline.

If either of the two requirements are not met, the submission will be deemed incomplete and will recieve a grade of 0. Please see the requirements documents for each assignemnt for more specific details.



<u>**TO BE CLEAR**: You will receive a 0 on your assignment if any of the following apply:</u> 

* The assignment survey was not submitted.
* The assignment was not submitted in its entirety.
* The assignment doesn't compile or was non-functional.
* The assignment or survey were submitted late, even if only by a few seconds. 
* The assignment was plagiarized, borrowed, or copied.



#### Grading Policy and Regrade Requests:

Each assignment will be graded following its corresponding rubric (see table above). Your grades will be shared as an "Issue" in your personal course repository within two weeks on the submission deadline. In the unlikely event of an error in grading you're assignment, you will have 24 hours to request a regrade. <u>Regrade requests made 24 hours or after grades have been published will not be considered</u>. 



#### Grade Adjustments:

Your lowest grade in the set of assignments {1, 2, 3} will be replaced with your next lowest grade in that same set of assignments (i.e. assignments {1, 2, 3}). For example: if you made a 0%, 90%, and 70% in Homework 1, 2, and 3 respectively - then your grade for Homework 1 would be changed from a 0% to a 70%.
